<p>Galvanizing provides steel with a thin layer of zinc to protect it from corrosion. The cathodic effect of the zinc coating prevents the corrosion of the iron to a distance of about 5 mm, so that also defects in the zinc layer and bare cutting edges are protected. However, the resulting bimetallic corrosion accelerates the removal of the adjacent zinc layer. Of course chromium (VI) -free, ROHS2 compliant.</p>

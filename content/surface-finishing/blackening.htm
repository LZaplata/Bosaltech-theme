<p>Blackening is used to form a weak protective layer (precious rust) on mostly ferrous surfaces in order to reduce corrosion. By immersing the workpieces in acidic or alkaline solutions (for example sodium hydroxide solution) or molten salts, black mixed oxide layers of iron (II, III) oxide (FeO and Fe 2 O 3) are formed. The blackening is not a coating.</p>

<p>The anodizing process is a method of surface technology for producing an oxide protective layer on aluminum by anodic oxidation. In this case, in contrast to the galvanic coating method, the protective layer is not deposited on the workpiece, but formed by conversion of the uppermost metal layer, an oxide or hydroxide. The result is a 5 to 25 micron thin layer, the deeper layers as long as protects against corrosion, as no gaps, for example, by mechanical damage, arise in this layer.</p>

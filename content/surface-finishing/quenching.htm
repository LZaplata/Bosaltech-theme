<p>The hardening of steel is an increase of its mechanical resistance by purposeful change and transformation of its structure. It can be done by heat treatment with subsequent quenching (sudden cooling). If a metal is plastically deformed, dislocations spread in the workpiece. In order to increase the strength, measures must be taken which impede the movement of dislocations.</p>
